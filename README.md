# Vim

```

A keyboard layout that's *somewhat* optimized for vim motions.
Only works in normal and visual mode.

There are some inroll optimizations specifically for motions such as "viw", "yap" and "cl".
The "EW", "TF" and "AI" pairs can be swapped for a *slightly* better insert mode experience. (though there's no point in doing that)
