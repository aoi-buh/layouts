# Vim

```
t m r g ' ; p b a y
f u d k , . h w i v
: z x j n s l e o c
```

A keyboard layout that's *somewhat* optimized for vim motions.

*Only works in normal and visual mode.*

Features:
- Q is removed because the world outside vim is ugly. ![alt text](https://github.com/aoi-buh/layouts/blob/main/no%20macros.jpg "that's me")
- Similar functions are placed on the same column.
- There are some inroll optimizations specifically for motions such as "viw", "yap" and "cl".
- The "EW", "TF" and "AI" pairs can be swapped for a *slightly* better insert mode experience. (though there's no point in doing that)
- The "KJ" and "HL" groups can also be swapped as well but at the sacrifice of cl.
